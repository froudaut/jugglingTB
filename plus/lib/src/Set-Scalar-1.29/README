The first priority of Set::Scalar is to be a convenient interface
to sets (as in: unordered colletions of Perl scalars.)  While not
designed to be slow or big, neither has it been designed to be
fast or compact.

Please see lib/Set/Scalar.pm for more information, once you have
installed this module, "perldoc Set::Scalar" should work.
