Win32::Console::ANSI version 1.11
=================================

Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista does not support ANSI escape sequences in
Win32 Console applications.
This module emulate an ANSI console for the script which uses it.

This module can convert the characters from Windows code page
to DOS code page (the so-called ANSI to OEM conversion).
This conversion permits the display of the accented characters
in the console like in a Windows-based editor.

It works on all Win32 platforms:
Win98, Win98SE, Win2000, WinXP, Windows Server 2003, Vista (32 and 64 bits)
Windows 7 (32 and 64 bits), Windows 8 (32 and 64 bits), Windows 10 32 and 64 bits)

All suggestion or remark is welcome.

DEPENDENCIES

Win32::Pipe and Win32::Process are necessary only for the tests.
