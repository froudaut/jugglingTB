1.01  2008/07/07
  Just added some auxiliary functions
  - ShowConsoleWindow: changes the console window's show state (hide, max, min...),
  - MinimizeAll: minimizes all the windows on the desktop,
  - SetCloseButton: enables/disables the close button [x] of the console window,
  - SetConsoleFullScreen: sets the console in full-screen or windowed mode (WinXP/Vista)
  - SetMonitorState: sets the monitor state (on/off/standby).

1.00  2005/07/03
  The module has been rewritten in C.
  By hooking the WriteFile API function in all the modules loaded by the
  script, it is possible to interpret the escape sequences just before they
  are written in the console.
  This suppresses several previous versions limitations:
  - no tied handles (we can duplicate STDOUT or STDERR as usual and the
    module works now with IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3)
  - the bug with the join method is fixed. We can use threads.
  - The conversion of the Windows codepage to the console codepage (ANSI to
    OEM conversion) is done by the internal Windows functions. The
    Encode module is not used anymore (the exe made with PAR are smaller).
  - The module is smaller and faster.

0.07  2005/01/02
  - it's now possible to redirect STDERR or STDOUT to a file.
    Request from Phoeares Tsai.
  - added two auxiliary functions 'Title' and 'Cursor'.
  - improved the doc (limitations)

0.06  2004/09/20
  - bug: with \e[#K, if the cursor is on the last line of the console,
         a new line is added. -fixed.
    Thanks to Eric Zmiro for reporting this bug.
  - STDIN and STDERR are tied only if there are tty

0.05  2004/02/26
  - bug: the variable $, has no effect on print! -fixed.
  - the module takes now the pragma -w and (use warnings) into account.
  - bug: print '0' print nothing! -fixed
    Thanks to Daniel Schoene to report this bug.

0.04  2003/10/09
  - bug: the printf function doesn't work as expected! -fixed.
    Thanks to Mark A. Rudolph to report this bug.

0.03  2003/07/21
  - bug: print $s; with $s undef gives two error messages.
    fixed: now the module croaks.
  - bug: print "\e[m" x 100; dies with error message:
    Deep recursion on subroutine "Win32::Console::ANSI::IO::_PrintString"
    fixed: the routine is now iterative, not recursive.
  - bug: \e(K now restore the original code page.
  - fixed some typo in doc and test.pl

0.02  2003/07/13
