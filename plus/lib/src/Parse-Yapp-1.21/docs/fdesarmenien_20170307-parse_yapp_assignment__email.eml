Hi,

Here is the signed document.

Congratulations : you are now officially the copyright holder for the =
Parse::Yapp modules, although
it would be nice of you not to forget to keep my name attached to the =
copyright notices as the original
creator and copyright holder of the original modules (mostly for =
sentimental reasons :-)).

Enjoy and best regards,

Fran=C3=A7ois
