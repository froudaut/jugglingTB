HTTP::Server::Simple is a very simple standalone HTTP daemon with no non-core
module dependencies.  It's ideal for building a standalone http-based UI to
your existing tools.  

This code is a derivative of the "standalone_httpd" tool used by RT.

It's desperately short of tests and documentation. It wants your love and help.
