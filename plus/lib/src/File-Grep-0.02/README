File/Grep version $Revision: 0.02 $
================================

File::Grep provides similar functionality as perl's builtin grep, map,
and foreach commands, but iterating over a passed filelist instead of
arrays.  While trivial, this module can provide a quick dropin when
such functionality is needed.
